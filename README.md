## Reflection

In what ways were the use of linked lists particularly appropriate for this assignment?

Linked lists were especially appropriate because the structure of a card pile naturally matches a list where elements can be easily added, removed, or rearranged. Operations like splitting a pile, inserting cards after a specific point, or moving a sequence of cards to another pile are much simpler and more efficient with a linked list than with an array. Since linked lists allow for quick insertions and deletions without shifting elements, they made it easier to model dynamic gameplay actions.

What was the major challenge you faced in completing this assignment?

The main challenge was correctly managing iterators and references when moving or inserting cards between piles. It was easy to accidentally reverse the order of cards or duplicate/remove them if the iterator logic wasnâ€™t handled carefully.

What do you feel you learned from this assignment?

I learned that you can use graphics in java. I learned how to apply linked list operations in a real, interactive setting and how different data structures affect program behavior. I also gained experience with event-driven programming in Java, especially handling mouse events to create a more dynamic GUI.
